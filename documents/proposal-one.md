title: Proposal for creation of a SPE to ensure MakerDAO Auction Success
author: DAI Backstop Syndicate
date: March 13th, 20202
version 2020.03.13
</pre>

## Terms
- Syndicate: Shall Reference 'DAI Backstop Syndicate Community Organizers'
- Special Purpose Entity: The instrument by which the 'syndicate' acts through, abbr. 'SPE'
- Lender of Last Resort: 
- DAI: An ERC-20 Token, [0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f)
- MKR: An ERC-20 Token, [0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2)
- MakerDAO: A protocol that creates DAI loans when users load ETH into the system as collateral. MakerDAO then automatically sells that collateral when the market price changes in order to get DAI off the market until the system hits its 150 percent collateral target. 
- Sufficient: condition A is said to be sufficient for a condition B, if (and only if) the truth (/existence /occurrence) [as the case may be] of A guarantees (or brings about) the truth (/existence /occurrence) of B.
- Necessary: condition A is said to be necessary for a condition B, if (and only if) the falsity (/nonexistence /non-occurrence) [as the case may be] of A guarantees (or brings about) the falsity (/nonexistence /non-occurrence) of B.

## Objectives
- Establish a 'Syndicate' in which pooled resources can be put together
- Create a "Special Purpose Entity" to leverage said pooled resources of Syndicate
- The "SPE" shall bid in a manner properly alinged with stated objectives of the DAI Backstop Syndicate
- To provide enough confidence in the auction process that the auction is a success.
- To provide a source of funds that will participate in the auction should no market arise

## Key Results 

- MakerDAO Auction should be successful without "SPE" intervention
- Should Auction 'fail', "SPE" shall intervene in said auction and participate using funds provided by the 
syndicate'
- Should the 'SPE' not be utilized, funds shall be returned within <x amount of y days>
- Should the 'SPE' participate in the auction, distributions of *MKR* shall be distributed within <x amount of y days>

<define: what is considered a sucessful auction>


## Considerations

* Due to price change exceeding the possibility for MakerDAO's automated auctions to keep up, DAI may be in technical default.

* Estimated that at least $4 million of its dollar-pegged dai stablecoin not backed by an underlying crypto asset, according to a stakeholder call held Thursday.

* If a shutdown were to occur, the crypto market would be flooded with some 2.4 million ETH even as the asset’s value plummets amid broader market turmoil.

* Necessary conditions for participation in MakerDAO Auction shall be the non-occurance of a viable auction at {specific_date_for_makerdao_auction}

# Implementation 
This is the specific guidelines and contractual outline of 'proposal one'

### Terms and Conditions

(1) Events
(a) Auction. 
	(i) If the MakerDAO Auction happens before the expiration or termination of this instrument, 
	(ii) If the MakerDAO Auction occurs and the SPE *participates*  
	(iii) If the MakerDAO Auction occurs and the SPE *does not participate*

(b) Participation in the MakerDAO Auction

In connection with and prior to the issuance of Tokens by the MakerDAO Auction to the SPE, Syndicate Participants pursuant to this Section 1(a):

(i) The Syndicate Participant will execute and deliver to the SPE any and all other transaction documents related to this document, including verification of accredited investor status or non-U.S. person status under the applicable securities laws; and

(ii) The Syndicate Participant will provide to the SPE a network address for which to allocate Syndicate Participant's Tokens in the event of the SPE's participation in the MakerDAO 'MKR' Auction

(c) Dissolution Event. 
If there is a Dissolution Event before this instrument expires or terminates, the SPE will pay an amount equal to Syndicate Participants less transaction fees on the Ethereum Main Network [Ethereum Foundation Network] due and payable to the Syndicate Participant immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the Dissolution Event, subject to the rights and preferences of the holders of the SPE’s "first in, first out" policy, as set forth in the SPE’s adopted "Proposal". If immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event, the assets of the SPE that remain legally available for distribution to the Syndicate Participant, as determined in good faith by the SPE’s Acting Administrator, are insufficient to permit the payment to the Dissolving Syndicate Participants of their respective Purchase Amounts, then the remaining assets of the SPE legally available for distribution, following all distributions to the holders of the SPE’s pooled resources, will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Dissolving Syndicate Participants in proportion to the Purchase Amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1(b). Any distributed amounts shall be in in the respective currency used to fund the SPE.

(d) Termination. This instrument will expire and terminate upon the earlier of (i) the non-participation in the MakerDAO Auction  to the Syndicate Participant pursuant to Section 1(a); (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Syndicate Participant pursuant to Section 1(b); (iii) [DATE] (the “Deadline Date”), if the MakerDAO auction has not occurred as of such date; provided that, the SPE shall have the right to extend the Deadline Date by fourteen (14) days, in its sole discretion;


(e) This instrument sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous disclosures, discussions, understandings and agreements, whether oral of written, between them. 

(f) Any notice required or permitted by this instrument will be deemed sufficient when sent by email to the relevant address listed on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice received by the appropriate party.

(g) The Syndicate Participant is not entitled, as a holder of this instrument, to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of capital stock of the SPE for any purpose, nor will anything contained herein be construed to confer on the Syndicate Participant, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the SPE or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive subscription rights or otherwise.

(h) Neither this instrument nor the rights contained herein may be assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, by either party without the prior written consent of the other; provided, however, that this instrument and/or the rights contained herein may be assigned without the SPE’s consent by the Syndicate Participant to any other entity who directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Syndicate Participant, including, without limitation, any general partner, managing member, officer or director of the Syndicate Participant, or any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing which is controlled by one or more general partners or managing members of, or shares the same management SPE with, the Syndicate Participant; and provided, further, that the SPE may assign this instrument in whole, without the consent of the Syndicate Participant, in connection with a reincorporation to change the SPE’s domicile.

(i) In the event any one or more of the provisions of this instrument is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part or in any respect, or in the event that any one or more of the provisions of this instrument operate or would prospectively operate to invalidate this instrument, then and in any such event, such provision(s) only will be deemed null and void and will not affect any other provision of this instrument and the remaining provisions of this instrument will remain operative and in full force and effect and will not be affected, prejudiced, or disturbed thereby.
