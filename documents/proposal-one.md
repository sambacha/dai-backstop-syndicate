author: DAI Backstop Syndicate
date: March 13th, 20202

</pre>

## Terms
- Syndicate: Shall Reference 'DAI Backstop Syndicate Community Organizers'
- Special Purpose Entity: The instrument by which the 'syndicate' acts through 
- Lender of Last Resort: 
- DAI: An ERC-20 Token, [0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f)
- MKR: An ERC-20 Token, [0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2)
- MakerDAO: A protocol that creates DAI loans when users load ETH into the system as collateral. MakerDAO then automatically sells that collateral when the market price changes in order to get DAI off the market until the system hits its 150 percent collateral target. 
- <syndicate_contract_address>
- <syndicate_wallet_addresses>

## Objectives
- Establish a 'Syndicate' in which pooled resources can be put together
- Create a "Special Purpose Entity" to leverage said pooled resources of Syndicate
- The "SPE" shall bid in a manner properly alinged with stated objectives of the DAI Backstop Syndicate
- To provide enough confidence in the auction process that the auction is a success.
- To provide a source of funds that will participate in the auction should no market arise

## Key Results 

- MakerDAO Auction should be successful without "SPE" intervention
- Should Auction 'fail', "SPE" shall intervene in said auction and participate using funds provided by the 
syndicate'

<define: what is considered a sucessful auction>


## Considerations

* Due to price change exceeding the possibility for MakerDAO's automated auctions to keep up, DAI may be in technical default.

* Estimated that at least $4 million of its dollar-pegged dai stablecoin not backed by an underlying crypto asset, according to a stakeholder call held Thursday.

* If a shutdown were to occur, the crypto market would be flooded with some 2.4 million ETH even as the asset’s value plummets amid broader market turmoil.
